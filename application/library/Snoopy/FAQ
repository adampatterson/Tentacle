Q:	Why can't I fetch https pages?
A:	Using Snoopy to fetch an https page requires curl. Check if curl is installed on your host. If curl is installed, it may be located in a different place than the default. By default Snoopy looks for curl in /usr/local/bin/curl. Run 'which curl' and find out your location. If it differs from the default, then you'll need to set the $snoopy->curl_path variable to the location of your curl installation. Here's an example of the code :
		include "Snoopy.class.php";
		$snoopy = new Snoopy;
		$snoopy->curl_path="/usr/bin/curl";

Raptor Editor
===

Raptor Editor is a user-focused extensible WYSIWYG website content editor - check out the [Demo][^4].

**It is designed to be user and developer friendly**

Usage
---

Instantiating the Raptor editor with no options (zero configuration) results in all buttons and plugins being enabled.
This is the quickest and easiest way to see Raptor in action.

```HTML
<div id="element-to-edit"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github.com/PANmedia/Raptor/master/packages/raptor.0deps.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
    $('#element-to-edit').editor();
</script>

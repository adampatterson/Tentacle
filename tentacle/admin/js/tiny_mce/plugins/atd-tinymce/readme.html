   <h1>After the Deadline for TinyMCE - README</h1>

   <p><a href="http://www.afterthedeadline.com">After the Deadline</a> is an <a href="http://open.afterthedeadline.com">open source</a> software service that checks 
   <a href="http://www.afterthedeadline.com/features.slp">spelling, style, and grammar.</a> This package contains an AtD TinyMCE Plugin and an example for using After the Deadline
   with <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com">TinyMCE</a>.</p>

   <h3>Quick Start</h3>

   <ol>
     <li>Extract the contents of this zip file into the tiny_mce/plugins directory.</li>
     <li>You'll need to make up an API key. Ideally your application name followed by a string that is unique to this user is best. There is a performance benefit to using the same key for subsequent requests.</li>
     <li>You'll need to set three variables in your TinyMCE init:
      <ul>
         <p><strong>atd_rpc_id</strong>
         <br />An API key that you make up (e.g., WPORG-dkfjhds)</p>

         <p><strong>atd_rpc_url</strong>
         <br />the URL to post to, a proxy PHP script is included.  This will redirect all calls to http://service.afterthedeadline.com/  Use: htp://yourserver.com/path/to/AtD/proxy.php?url= for this. <em>Note: the '?url=' portion is expected by the included proxy.php script</em></p>

         <p><strong>atd_css_url</strong>
         <br />the URL of the <a href="css/content.css">content.css</a> file. Edit this file to change the appearance of AtD errors.</p>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You'll need a proxy script on your server. Use the included proxy.php if you can. Otherwise you'll need to write your own.</li>

    <li>As a final note, make sure your webpage is encoded in UTF-8 format. AJAX requests use the encoding of the parent website and AtD expects UTF-8. This is important as AtD has better support for accented characters and we're working to support more languages.</li>
  </ol>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>If you've unzipped this archive on a webserver with PHP installed, you should be able to access <a href="demo.html">demo.html</a> directly and see everything work.</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="demo.html">demo.html</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Using your own AtD Server</h3>

<p>You can download the After the Deadline server from <a href="http://open.afterthedeadline.com">open.afterthedeadline.com</a> and serve your own requests. If
you go this route, modify <em>server/proxy.php</em> to connect to your AtD host. All the other steps are the same.</p>

<h3>Ignore Phrases Capability (Optional)</h3>

<p>After the Deadline lets you specify a list of phrases it should not highlight. This is the AtD equivalent of add to dictionary functionality in other programs.
You can hardcode these values in the <code>atd_ignore_strings</code> value in TinyMCE init. 
The format is a comma separated list of phrases.  (See example below for more).</p>

<p>Users can choose to ignore phrases by selecting <em>Ignore always</em> when clicking 
a highlighted phrase.  You have to enable this feature for the <em>Ignore always</em>
menu to show up.  Do so by setting the <code>atd_ignore_enable</code> to the string <code>"true"</code>
in TinyMCE init.</p>

<p>If you see <em>Ignore all</em> when clicking an error then this feature is disabled.</p>

<h4>Manage Ignored Phrases with Cookies</h4>

<p>There is a caveat to this client side ignore capability.  You get to create the
user interface for unignoring rules.  The phrases are stored in a cookie named
<code>atd_ignore</code>.  This cookie was created with:</p>

<p><code>tinymce.util.Cookie.setHash("atd_ignore", ...);</code></p>

<p>The format of the cookie is <em>some+phrase=1&amp;someWord=1&amp;...</em>.  See the <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/js/tinymce/docs/api/index.html#">TinyMCE API</a>
for <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/js/tinymce/docs/api/index.html#class_tinymce.util.Cookie.html">tinymce.util.Cookie</a>.</p>

<p><a href="support/atdphrases.js">support/atdphrases.js</a> and <a href="support/unignore.html">support/unignore.html</a> are included in this archive to assist you.</p>

<h4>Manage Ignored Phrases Yourself</h4>

<p>The best option is to manage the ignored phrases preference on your server. We do this in our <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/after-the-deadline/">WordPress 
plugin</a>. When we generate the TinyMCE init we pull the user's ignore preferences from our database and populate the <code>atd_ignore_strings</code> value with them.</p>

<p>The AtD TinyMCE plugin can be configured to make an AJAX call to your server when a user selects <em>Ignore Always</em>. To enable this set <code>atd_ignore_rpc_url</code> in the 
TinyMCE init. When set AtD will do a GET call to this URL with <em>the ignored phrase&key=api key</em> appended.</p>

<h3>Error Categories</h3>

<p>This TinyMCE plugin only shows grammar, spelling, and misused word errors by default.  All other categories of errors are filtered and you must explicitly
enable them in the TinyMCE init parameters by setting the <code>atd_show_types</code> variable.</p>

<p><code>atd_show_types: "Bias Language,Cliches,Complex Expression,Diacritical Marks,Double Negatives,Hidden Verbs,Jargon Language,Passive voice,Phrases to Avoid,Redundant Expression",</code></p>

<p>You may omit any of these categories.  Note that categories are separated by commas with no whitespace.  The category names are case sensitive and yes, voice is lowercase in Passive voice.</p>

<h3>Localization</h3>

<p>To localize the strings in this extension, create an object with the localized strings. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>var my_plugin_strings = {
   menu_title_spelling: "Spelling",
   menu_title_repeated_word: "Repeated	Word",
   menu_option_explain: "Explain...",
   menu_option_ignore_once: "Ignore suggestion",
   menu_option_ignore_always: "Ignore always",
   button_proofread_tooltip: "Proofread Writing"
   message_no_errors_found: "No writing errors were found.",
   message_server_error: "There was a problem communicating with the After the Deadline service. Try again in one minute."
};</pre>

<p>Then make TinyMCE use these strings:</p>

<pre>tinyMCE.addI18n('en.AtD', my_plugin_strings);</pre>

<p>Note: I used <em>en.AtD</em> to indicate <em>my_plugin_strings</em> are an English translation of this AtD extension. For other languages use
<em><b>lang</b>.AtD</em> where <em><b>lang</b></em> is the two letter language code value specified for <em>language</em> in your TinyMCE init.</p>

<p>These string labels are compatible with the <a href="http://www.afterthedeadline.com/download.slp?platform=jQuery">AtD/jQuery extension</a>.</p>
